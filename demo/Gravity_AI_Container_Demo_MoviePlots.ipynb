Marty auditions for the Battle of the Bands but is rejected for being too loud. At home Martys father George is bullied by his supervisor Biff Tannen while his mother Lorraine is an overweight depressed alcoholic. Lorraine recalls how she met George when her father hit him with his car.\r\n",
      "Marty is invited by his friend eccentric inventor Dr. Emmett Brown to meet him in a parking lot in the early hours. Doc unveils a time machine built from a modified DeLorean and powered by plutonium stolen from terrorists. Preparing to demonstrate the time machine Doc sets the date to November 5 1955: the day he invented time travel. The terrorists arrive and shoot Doc. Marty escapes in the DeLorean but inadvertently activates the time machine.\r\n",
      "Marty finds himself in 1955 without enough plutonium to return. He encounters the teenaged George who is bullied by his classmate Biff. After Marty saves George from an oncoming car he is knocked unconscious and awakens to find himself tended to by Lorraine who is infatuated with him.\r\n",
      "Marty tracks down Docs younger self for help. With no plutonium Doc explains that the only power source capable of generating the necessary 1.21 gigawatts of electricity for the time machine is a bolt of lightning. Marty shows Doc a flyer from the future that recounts a lightning strike at the towns courthouse due the coming Saturday night.\r\n",
      "Doc instructs Marty to not leave his house or interact with anyone as he could inadvertently alter the future; because of this Doc refuses to heed warnings from Marty about his death in 1985. Marty realizes that he has prevented his parents from meeting and Doc warns him that Marty will be erased from existence if he does not find a way to introduce George to Lorraine. Doc formulates a plan to harness the power of the lightning while Marty sets about introducing his parents.\r\n",
      "After Lorraine asks Marty to the school dance Marty concocts a plan: he will feign inappropriate advances on Lorraine allowing George to rescue her. The plan goes awry when a drunken Biff attempts to force himself on Lorraine. George enraged knocks out Biff and Lorraine follows him to the dance floor where they kiss while Marty performs with the band.\r\n",
      "As the storm arrives Marty returns to the clock tower and the lightning strikes sending Marty back to 1985. Doc has survived the shooting as he had listened to Martys warnings and worn a bullet proof vest. Doc takes Marty home and departs to the future. Marty awakens the next morning to find that George is a successful author Lorraine is fit and happy and Biff is now an obsequious auto valet. As Marty reunites with Jennifer the DeLorean appears with Doc insisting they accompany him to 2015 to resolve a problem with their future children. The trio board the DeLorean and warp to the future.\n"

Two bandits enter an express car kill a messenger and open a box of valuables with dynamite; the others kill the fireman and force the engineer to halt the train and disconnect the locomotive.

Things start to go wrong and the wife gets violent and starts throwing crockery leading to her arrest.'}, {'id': 'The Little Train Robbery', 'text': 'The opening scene shows the interior of the robbers den. The walls are decorated with the portraits of notorious criminals and pictures illustrating the exploits of famous bandits. Some of the gang are lounging about while others are reading novels and illustrated papers. Although of youthful appearance each is dressed like a typical Western desperado. The Bandit Queen leading a blindfolded new recruit now enters the room. He is led to the center of the room raises his right hand and is solemnly sworn in. When the bandage is removed from his eyes he finds himself looking into the muzzles of a dozen or more 45s. The gang then congratulates the new member and heartily shake his hand. The Bandit Queen who is evidently the leader of the gang now calls for volunteers to hold up a train. All respond but she picks out seven for the job who immediately leave the cabin.\\r\\nThe next scene shows the gang breaking into a barn. They steal ponies and ride away. Upon reaching the place agreed upon they picket their ponies and leaving them in charge of a trusted member proceed to a wild mountain spot in a bend of the railroad where the road runs over a steep embankment. The spot is an ideal one for holding up a train. Cross ties are now placed on the railroad track and the gang hide in some bushes close by and wait for the train. The train soon approaches and is brought to a stop. The engineer leaves his engine and proceeds to remove the obstruction on the track. While he is bending over one of the gang sneaks up behind them and hits him on the head with an axe and knocks him senseless down the embankment while the gang surround the train and hold up the passengers. After securing all the valuables consisting principally of candy and dolls the robbers uncouple the engine and one car and make their escape just in time to avoid a posse of police who appear on the scene. Further up the road they abandon the engine and car take to the woods and soon reach their ponies.\\r\\nIn the meantime the police have learned the particulars of the hold up from the frightened passengers and have started up the railroad tracks after the fleeing robbers. The robbers are next seen riding up the bed of a shallow stream and finally reach their den where the remainder of the gang have been waiting for them. Believing they have successfully eluded their pursuers they proceed to divide the plunder. The police however have struck the right trail and are in close pursuit. While the plunder is being divided a sentry gives the alarm and the entire gang abandoning everything rush from the cabin barely in time to escape capture. The police make a hurried search and again start in pursuit. The robbers are so hard pressed that they are unable to reach their ponies and are obliged to take chances on foot. The police now get in sight of the fleeing robbers and a lively chase follows through tall weeds over a bridge and up a steep hill. Reaching a pond the police are close on their heels. The foremost robbers jump in clothes and all and strike out for the opposite bank. Two hesitate and are captured. Boats are secured and after an exciting tussle the entire gang is rounded up. In the mix up one of the police is dragged overboard. The final scene shows the entire gang of bedraggled and crestfallen robbers tied together with a rope and being led away by the police. Two of the police are loaded down with revolvers knives and cartridge belts and resemble walking aresenals. As a fitting climax a confederate steals out of the woods cuts the rope and gallantly rescues the Bandit Queen.'}, {'id': 'The Night Before Christmas', 'text': 'Scenes are introduced using lines of the poem.[2] Santa Claus played by Harry Eytinge is shown feeding real reindeer[4] and finishes his work in the workshop.
