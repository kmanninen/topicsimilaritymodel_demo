The people also strongly venerate an elderly Neanderthal woman the last of her kind called Old Mother who has shamanistic powers. As time goes by the mammoths that supply the people start to dwindle and the chief of the tribe finds a young girl with blue eyes named Evolet who survived a massacre of her village perpetrated by what Old Mother calls four legged demons who will come when the Yagahl go on their last hunt. The chief of the village not believing in Old Mothers prophecy and desperate to feed his people leaves and gives the White Spear to his friend TicTic who also watches over DLeh the chiefs son. As TicTic alone is entrusted to know of the quest all the others in the tribe including DLehs rival KaRen believe that DLehs father was a coward and fled. Over time DLeh and Evolet fall in love and become close.\\r\\nWhen the mammoths finally come DLeh and the other men of the tribe hunt them under TicTics leadership and DLeh manages to kill one by causing the beast into impaling itself on his spear inadvertently winning the White Spear.

TicTic dies from injuries sustained in the fight that follows with the guards though not before killing them before they can raise the alarm. The Almightys priests also meanwhile come to believe that Evolet is destined to kill The Almighty based on the whip scars on her hands matching the stars they call the Mark of the Hunter and an ancient prophecy foreseeing their civilizations downfall. The Almighty realizes that Evolet is not the focus of the prophecy but the hunters DLehs herald. DLeh then starts a rebellion among the slaves killing many of the Almightys forces though KaRen is killed.\\r\\nThe Almighty offers Evolet and the other hunters to DLeh in exchange for abandoning his rebellion. DLeh feigns acceptance of the deal but throws a spear at The Almighty and kills him.

His wife Carol suffers extreme depression and rarely gets out of bed while he works in his practice meeting some clients referred to him by his mentor Duncan. One client Felix apparently suffers from anterograde amnesia believing that it is still the 80s; another Erica talks of her suicidal thoughts but finds herself unable to commit suicide; and another Elizabeth Valentine is a girl who is apparently mute and who reacts with fear to the sound of the train passing by Peters office and before she flees she writes a series of numbers on one of Peters notepads: 12787.\\r\\nElizabeth returns unexpectedly and Peter finds her looking out of his window to where the train will pass. Again she is disturbed by the sound of it and begins to choke; she hits the window leaving a handprint. Peter records her but she disappears before he can speak to her further. He plays the recording to Duncan who claims he hears nothing and believes that Peter is hallucinating Elizabeth out of guilt from failing to prevent his daughters death pointing out that her initials sound like Evies name. Later Peter hallucinates Elizabeth saying that we have her before turning into Evie and then vanishing and later he has a nightmare about Erica who says she wasnt able to commit suicide because shes already dead. Doing research Peter discovers that Elizabeth died in 1987 along with all the other clients who had been seeing him. The numbers that Elizabeth wrote on his notepad was a date: July 12 1987. Perplexed he calls Duncan and asks to speak with him later and then has a vision of his deceased patients on the train outside of his window.\\r\\nDuncan comes over and Peter worries about his sanity and questions how Duncan could have referred the patients when all of them have been deceased for decades. He then notices that Duncan doesnt appear in a mirror and he too is a ghost. Now fully disturbed Peter uses a map to discover that all the deceased patients lived along a train line leading to his hometown False Creek. He travels there alone and meets with his father William a retired cop. Going to the bar Peter meets with a childhood friend Barry and tells him that there is a weight on his conscience that he wants lifted. Barry alludes to a horrifying event that happened in their youth that they promised to keep a secret and tells Peter to leave him out of any confession.\\r\\nWhen the two were teenagers Barry led Peter to a secret location that his brother mentioned where couples would apparently have sex in their cars.

However neither got there in time and the train was violently derailed killing 47 of the passengers on board. Peter saw several of the victims all of whom would be his deceased future clients. He is then terrorized by the ghosts of Evie Felix and Elizabeth.\\r\\nThe next morning Barry drives to the train tracks and Peter goes to the police station. There he meets Barbara a constable and confesses the incident to her. She tells him that he will likely face no charges as it was an accident that happened when he was a teenager and the statute of limitations has expired. Peter also discovers that she was the daughter of Erica. He apologizes and Barbara tells him that her mother was the only local killed in the accident and that William was kind to her at the funeral inspiring her to become a police officer.\\r\\nBarbara investigates the accident while Peter tries and fails to burn his newspaper clipping of the accident. He is drawn to a closet where the ghost of Elizabeth briefly strangles him. Duncan then appears telling him that there was no way that bicycles lying against the tracks would have derailed the train and that there was more to the accident.

Furthermore Elizabeth was the only victim with a cause of death that the coroners deemed inconclusive. Meanwhile Peter sees Elizabeths ghost once more and taking the same path he did as the night of the accident he realizes that it was not Barry he saw running ahead of him but Elizabeth. Going up to the switch house he suddenly remembers all of the night: he looked through the windows of the house to see his father strangling Elizabeth. In her struggle to survive she left a handprint on the window the same one he saw earlier and she also accidentally pulled the levers of the train tracks leading it to derail and kill the passengers. Afterwards William placed her body at the scene of the crash.\\r\\nBarbara asserts to William that she knows Elizabeth was not a victim of the crash and she believes that Peter saw something that night that William wanted covered up. William knocks her unconscious and puts her in the trunk of his car. Peter returns and tells William that he knows the truth: the couple that Peter and Barry saw in the car was really William raping Elizabeth and he saw William kill her; he asks William if Elizabeth was his only victim. William pulls a gun on him and tells him to get in the garage. Inside Peter hears Barbara regain consciousness and after a brief struggle William knocks him unconscious as well.\\r\\nThe next morning William drives out with both Peter and Barbara restrained in the car.

Peter attempts to shoot out a window so William can escape but only succeeds when the train is extremely close. The trunk opens and Barbara manages to climb out and Peter pushes her off the tracks to safety. William held back by Elizabeths ghost is crushed by the train. As Peter and Barbara stand on the side of the tracks Peter can see the ghosts of the victims on the train and sees a tranquil Elizabeth turn and depart.\\r\\nLater Peter is on the beach with the ghost of Evie who gets up and walks into the ocean finally moving on and at peace. His wife joins him and asks what hes thinking about; Peter tells her that hes thinking about kids.

Two other men bearing signs reading His Photographer and His Press Agent respectively follow him into the shot; the photographer sets up his camera. Teddy aims his rifle upward at the tree and fells what appears to be a common house cat which he then proceeds to stab. Teddy holds his prize aloft and the press agent takes notes. The second shot is taken in a slightly different part of the wood on a path.

They then knock the operator out and tie him up. As the train stops it is boarded by the bandits?—?now four. Two bandits enter an express car kill a messenger and open a box of valuables with dynamite; the others kill the fireman and force the engineer to halt the train and disconnect the locomotive. The bandits then force the passengers off the train and rifle them for their belongings. One passenger tries to escape but is instantly shot down. Carrying their loot the bandits escape in the locomotive later stopping in a valley where their horses had been left.\\r\\nMeanwhile back in the telegraph office the bound operator awakens but he collapses again. His daughter arrives bringing him his meal and cuts him free and restores him to consciousness by dousing him with water.\\r\\nThere is some comic relief at a dance hall where an Eastern stranger is forced to dance while the locals fire at his feet. The door suddenly opens and the telegraph operator rushes in to tell them of the robbery. The men quickly form a posse which overtakes the bandits and in a final shootout kills them all and recovers the stolen mail.'}, {'id': 'The Suburbanite', 'text': 'The film is about a family who move to the suburbs hoping for a quiet life. Things start to go wrong and the wife gets violent and starts throwing crockery leading to her arrest.'}, {'id': 'The Little Train Robbery', 'text': 'The opening scene shows the interior of the robbers den. The walls are decorated with the portraits of notorious criminals and pictures illustrating the exploits of famous bandits. Some of the gang are lounging about while others are reading novels and illustrated papers. Although of youthful appearance each is dressed like a typical Western desperado. The Bandit Queen leading a blindfolded new recruit now enters the room. He is led to the center of the room raises his right hand and is solemnly sworn in. When the bandage is removed from his eyes he finds himself looking into the muzzles of a dozen or more 45s. The gang then congratulates the new member and heartily shake his hand. The Bandit Queen who is evidently the leader of the gang now calls for volunteers to hold up a train. All respond but she picks out seven for the job who immediately leave the cabin.\\r\\nThe next scene shows the gang breaking into a barn. They steal ponies and ride away. Upon reaching the place agreed upon they picket their ponies and leaving them in charge of a trusted member proceed to a wild mountain spot in a bend of the railroad where the road runs over a steep embankment. The spot is an ideal one for holding up a train. Cross ties are now placed on the railroad track and the gang hide in some bushes close by and wait for the train. The train soon approaches and is brought to a stop. The engineer leaves his engine and proceeds to remove the obstruction on the track. While he is bending over one of the gang sneaks up behind them and hits him on the head with an axe and knocks him senseless down the embankment while the gang surround the train and hold up the passengers. After securing all the valuables consisting principally of candy and dolls the robbers uncouple the engine and one car and make their escape just in time to avoid a posse of police who appear on the scene. Further up the road they abandon the engine and car take to the woods and soon reach their ponies.\\r\\nIn the meantime the police have learned the particulars of the hold up from the frightened passengers and have started up the railroad tracks after the fleeing robbers. The robbers are next seen riding up the bed of a shallow stream and finally reach their den where the remainder of the gang have been waiting for them. Believing they have successfully eluded their pursuers they proceed to divide the plunder. The police however have struck the right trail and are in close pursuit. While the plunder is being divided a sentry gives the alarm and the entire gang abandoning everything rush from the cabin barely in time to escape capture. The police make a hurried search and again start in pursuit. The robbers are so hard pressed that they are unable to reach their ponies and are obliged to take chances on foot. The police now get in sight of the fleeing robbers and a lively chase follows through tall weeds over a bridge and up a steep hill. Reaching a pond the police are close on their heels. The foremost robbers jump in clothes and all and strike out for the opposite bank. Two hesitate and are captured. Boats are secured and after an exciting tussle the entire gang is rounded up. In the mix up one of the police is dragged overboard. The final scene shows the entire gang of bedraggled and crestfallen robbers tied together with a rope and being led away by the police. Two of the police are loaded down with revolvers knives and cartridge belts and resemble walking aresenals. As a fitting climax a confederate steals out of the woods cuts the rope and gallantly rescues the Bandit Queen.'}, {'id': 'The Night Before Christmas', 'text': 'Scenes are introduced using lines of the poem.[2] Santa Claus played by Harry Eytinge is shown feeding real reindeer[4] and finishes his work in the workshop.
